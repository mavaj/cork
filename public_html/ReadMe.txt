Require you to write a SIMPLE SINGLE PAGE RESPONSIVE WEB PAGE that will display a typical multicolumn home page.

Do not use off-the-shelf templates or responsive frameworks (bootstrap,foundation, any grid system…). 
You are free, however, to use open source JavaScript libraries and other non-responsive frameworks (please document this).

You should: 

Use the attached wireframe as a guide for expected layouts on desktop and mobile (see figures 1 and 2 below). 
The page should display without any horizontal scrolling on all browser dimensions down to 320x480. Use the images 

as specified in the section below the figure. You are free to resize the images, but do not crop them or change their aspect ratio.
If you alter these images, include them alongside the index.html file.

The layout should be fully responsive for display width sizes from 320 pixels onwards.

If the device width is less than 600 pixels, only one column should be displayed. 
If the device width is between 600 and 799 pixels, two columns should be displayed. 
If the device width is 800 pixels or more, three columns should be displayed.

The three images inside the columns should resize from 250 pixels minimum to 400 pixels maximum and should be properly optimised.
The image size should depend on the amount of columns and the width available for these columns for the size of the display.
Aspect ration shall be maintained.

The three “blurbs” should contain 100 word Lorem Ipsum text as generated by http://www.blindtextgenerator.com/lorem-ipsum
truncation and without additional scrollbars (which means that the main page will most likely need to scroll vertically, especially on mobile devices).

Develop the page to function on a modern smartphone (Android, iPhone, or Chrome browser on desktop if you have no smartphone) 
and a desktop browser (both Chrome and Firefox)….you should test your page on a phone, but outline your testing approach, regardless of what testing is done.

If you complete the exercise in well under 3 hours, then consider enhancements to your page, such as: nice UI effects, alternative pagination mechanisms, etc

These should show without In building this solution we will be looking for a good understanding of: 

HTML5 technology 
Object Oriented JavaScript 
CSS3 and visual design 
Responsive design
Appropriate use of modern JavaScript frameworks 
Web dev best practices
Support material (documentation, testing, etc)
(URLs are better read on the next wireframe)

Along with your JavaScript, CSS etc, please deliver your page as a single index.html 
(with potentially additional js, css and jpg files). We will run the index.html from a server environment and expect it will work first time.
